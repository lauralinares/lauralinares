# Biography

My name is Laura Linares and I am a PhD candidate in Translation Studies at University College Cork. The title of my thesis is 'Mediating Minority: A Corpus-based Study of Galician literature into English', and uses corpus linguistics and data mining techiques to explore the strategies used by translators working on the mediation of narrative from a minority culture (Galician) into the English speaking-world. 

Before starting my PhD, I completed an MRes on Translation and Ideology and worked as a translator (both in-house and as a freelancer) and as a project manager. I am very interested in the influence of translation in cultural representation and the role of translation in the construction of identities in an interconnected, digital world, as well as the use of new media and digital narratives in a multilingual global society, and the application of corpus techniques and data analysis to the exploration of texts and their translations.
