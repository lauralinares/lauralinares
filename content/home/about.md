# Biography

My name is Laura Linares and I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Studies in University College Cork, working on the translation and mediation of narrative from a minority/minorized culture (Galician) into the hegemonic English speaking-world. Her project has been awarded the College of Arts, Celtic Studies and Social Sciences Excellence Scholarship and the Irish Research Council Postgraduate Scholarship. Prior to this, she completed her Masters by Research in Hispanic Studies with the thesis 'Translation and Ideology: Resistance in Plácido Castro’s Galician Version of the Rubáiyát of Omar Kháyyám'. 

My main research interests include translation and ideology, cultural representation, translation in non-hegemonic cultures and the role of translation in the construction of identities in a global world, as well as the application of corpus-based methodologies to the study of texts and their translations. Besides, through my work as a translator, both in-house and as a freelancer, I very much enjoy exploring the interconnections between theory and practice and how they may inform each other.
