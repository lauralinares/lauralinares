My PhD project "Mediating Minority: A Corpus-based study of Galician Literature Translated into English, focuses on the key role that translation has in cultural representation across borders, particularly in the context of a minority language. With over 1,500 books published in Galician every year (Observatorio da Cultura Galega 2015) and home to writers widely acclaimed in the Iberian Peninsula, such as Manuel Rivas or Suso de Toro, Galicia offers a vibrant literary scene that has become increasingly international in the past years thanks to the translation efforts of many publishing houses and cultural agents. This has been accompanied by increasing interest in academic contexts in Galicia’s intercultural relationships and the role of translation in their development. Many studies (Fernández Rodríguez et al.2012, 2015) deal with the flows of translation and the dynamics of the translation market and agents involved have been
undertaken with fascinating results, yet little attention has been paid so far to in-depth textual analyses of the translations and their reception in the Anglophone world, so it remains unclear what kind of vision of Galician literature and culture is actually being transmitted.
The aim of this project is to understand what strategies translators use when transferring texts from a literature written in a lesser-used language into a hegemonic language such as English, especially as relates to culture-specific references. In order to do this, a corpus with the full 32 works of narrative that have been translated from Galician into English between 1980 and 2015 will be created and used to carry out the textual analysis. The results from this observation will then be triangulated with information obtained through interviews with a sample of the translators about their translation processes and motives behind the strategies used. Finally, the project will aim to understand how Galician culture is received in Ireland and the UK by working with a number of reading groups in order to observe their response to the translations.

Other projects and initiatives I am involved in include:
