I have been teaching in UCC for the past for years and I am currently involved in the MA in Translation Studies, teaching **Contemporary Translation Theory and Practice** in the first semester and directing the short **Translation Project** that students have to do in the second semester in preparation for their final dissertation. Along with those modules, I will be giving a seminar and workshop on the use of corpora in Translation Studies and a videogame translation workshop in April.

Before this, from 2014 to 2017, I was the appointed Galician Lectora (a 3-year programme funded by the Galician government), and was  in charge of designing the programme for and teaching the following modules:

* Galician Language and Culture I
* Galician Language and Culture II
* Galician Language III
* Galician Cultural Studies
