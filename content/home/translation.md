I have been working as a professional translator, interpreter and proofreader since 2009, providing both agencies and direct customers with the best quality services from English/French into Spanish and Galician. I specialise in software, website and, most of all, videogame localisation; my clients include, among others Steam, Aeria Games, Big Fish Games or Level Up Translation.  As recipient of the Irish Research Council Postgraduate Scholarship for my PhD project, I am limited in the amount of work I can accept, so I am currently only considering creative projects that help me develop my writing/translating abilities or that are directly related to my research interests. My most recent project (EN-ES) was beautifully crafted game [Ghost of a Tale](http://www.ghostofatale.com/), set to be released in March 2018. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email or contact me through my social media profiles.
