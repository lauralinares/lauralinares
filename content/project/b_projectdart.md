Project DaRT of postgraduate researchers who aim to create a dynamic community of translation enthusiasts by reflecting on the application of theory to research in a supportive, open space. We aim to:

Read translation theory using innovative collaboration tools;

Reflect on the interplay between theory and practice and the role of research;

Share our reflections with other early-career and well-established researchers and practitioners, fostering the visibility of current research in the school and contributing to the activities organised by the Translation and Creative Practice Cluster in University College Cork. As part of our 2017/2018 seminar series, we have invited literary translator Sophie Hughes, translation scholars Dr Tom Cheesman and Dr. Kaisa Koskinen, and we will be actively participating in the School of Languages 'Translation Week' event in April, offering introductory workshops to current and possible future students.
