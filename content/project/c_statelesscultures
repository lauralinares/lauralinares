Stateless Cultures is a British Academy/Leverhulme-funded project led by Dr Olga Castro, from the University of Birmingham, for which I will be working as Research Assistant from March to June. Below is a summary of the general project. 

Translated literature makes up only 3.5% of the UK book market, with books from stateless nations and regional languages noticeably under-represented. To challenge this and to promote their cultures, the Catalan, Basque and Galician regional governments in Spain have invested substantially in translating their literatures abroad, with an increasing number of titles published in the UK between 2000-2015. Despite this financial effort, little is known about how successful these initiatives are from a British perspective. This project investigates the British circulation and reception – essential markers to measure the success of translation initiatives– of translations from these stateless cultures. Through the analysis of quantitative data, paratexts and interviews, it will offer unique insights into the extent to which translation policies from each of the source cultures are successful when considered in relation to patterns of circulation and reception. This study will be beneficial for source-culture policy-making and will also improve British understandings of cultural diversity in multilingual Spain
