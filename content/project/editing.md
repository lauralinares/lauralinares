Since spring 2017 I have been part of the team of editors who are relaunching the College of Arts, Celtic Studies and Social Sciences journal, called Aigne. In my role as website manager, I have transferred the journal to the Open Journal System, which will facilitate communication between authors, editors and reviewers, and have supported the rest of the team in becoming familiar with the new workflow. As part of the editing team, I am currently in charge of overviewing the peer-reviewing and publishing process for one of the articles for our summer issue (to be published in Summer 2018) and I have been part of the decision-making process for our Call for Papers for the Winter issue: 'Environments of Change'.

For more information about the journal and our submission process, please visit [aigne.ucc.ie]
